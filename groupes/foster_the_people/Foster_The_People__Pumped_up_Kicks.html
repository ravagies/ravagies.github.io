								Robert's got a quick hand.<br/>
								He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan.<br/>
								He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid.<br/>
								<br/><br/>
								Yeah, he found a six shooter gun.<br/>
								In his dad's closet hidden in a box of fun things, and I don't even know what.<br/>
								But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you.<br/>
								<br/><br/>
								(Refrain: x2)<br/>
								All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run, better run, outrun my gun.<br/>
								All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet.<br/>
								<br/><br/>
								Daddy works a long day.<br/>
								He be coming home late, yeah he's coming home late.<br/>
								And he's bringing me his dark surprise.<br/>
								'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice.<br/>
								<br/><br/>
								I've waited for a long time.<br/>
								Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger,<br/>
								I reason with my cigarette,<br/>
								And say your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah.<br/>
								<br/><br/>
								(refrain: x2)<br/>
								All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run, better run, outrun my gun.<br/>
								All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet.<br/>
								<br/><br/>
								
								(refrain: x3)<br/>
								All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run, better run, outrun my gun.<br/>
								All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet.
